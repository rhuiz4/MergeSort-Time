# MergeSort-Time by Team Last
Queenie Xiang, Henry Zheng, Rihui Zheng

##What Did We do?

We created integer arrays with length 1, 10, 100, etc. up to 1 million. We then found the runtime in nanoseconds it takes to sort through each array with MergeSort. We found out that it takes a long time to sort with 1 million elements in the array, and that the runtime is in the order of nlogn. You can view our findings [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFDN7kDtvYmu6oUdZt_P0vOQ0Qq7inmL3y_Kpg6lYog/pub).
